# Implementation of A* Path Planning Algorithm for differential drive action set

## Instructions:
- Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```
    cd AstarPathPlanner
    ```

- Alternatively, you can download the zip file of the repository and extract it to your local machine:

    ```

- Open Terminal and Run the following commands 
    ```
    python3 planner
    ```


## User input example



   

## Demo Video:
 - Video shows exploration of nodes and finding the goal node for a circular robot given start node, goal node, robot radius and clerance from obstacles. Once the shortest path is found, it is backtracked and visualized using openCV.
